                <p>To the left are the data for the clothing items. As you can see, the item most sold is the jeans. This means jeans would probably be sold more when put on the market.
                    From the graph, we can also see that sweaters are sold less than the others from its low height. This tells us that it would be better to not sell a sweater for the time being.</p>

                <p>The table and graph to the right show the data for the brand. From these, we can see that the brand that sold the most is Nike. Using this information,
                    we can infer that if we were to sell something at Nike, it would sell more. On the contrary, Gucci seems to sell less, most likely due to the fact it
                    is a luxury brand. From the data gathered we can tell that if we were to sell jeans at Nike, it would probably sell well.
